## Waffle

Waffle is a NFT raffle platform powered by chainlink. It allows anyone to raffle their own NFTs, by choosing the number of tickets and the price of each ticket. Like that, it's easier to sell expensive NFTs by increasing the liquidity in the market, and people with less means are still able to participate and get a chance at an expensive NFT.


## Smart contract

You can find the code of the smart contract here: https://github.com/Ajmasta/waffleContract



## What I learned
 It was interesting to use Chainlink VRF and to handle some scenarios (what if people ask for multiple raffles at the same time, how to make sure the random number generated is in a certain range, etc.). Overall I had a good experience building this project and I think that it has great future potential
 
 
 ## Future plans
 
 My future plans for this project are first to build a back-end to synchronize the eth smart contract with a Polygon smart contract. Like that, tx fees when buying tickets will be much lower which would make a lot more sense for the users.
 
 I also plan to improve the UI.
